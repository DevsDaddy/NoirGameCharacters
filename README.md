## About
**A bit of sad backstory**. The graphics were developed a long time ago - I wanted to use it to create my own game in the detective genre, for which I wrote a lot of code, script, created a lot of different resources. Now - all these resources are just lying idle and I will be glad if on the basis of them you can create the coolest game.

[See game backgrounds from these series here](https://github.com/DevsDaddy/NoirGameBackgrounds/).

**About licensing:**
**All resources can be used absolutely free of charge without attribution. Thank you for your support!**

**Also, I will be very glad to your financial support, because I really need it at this stage, but there is no time to develop the game itself:**
